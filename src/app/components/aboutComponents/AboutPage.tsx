          <p>
            It started with a simple question: how does a website actually work?
            That curiosity pulled me into code and gradually became a passion for
            building products people can genuinely use.
          </p>
          <p>
            I began with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then moved into React,
            Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Today, I build
            full-stack applications with authentication, role-based dashboards,
            payment integrations, and reliable backend systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learn best by building: choosing a project, facing difficult
            problems, understanding why something failed, and improving with
            every solution. Recently, I have also become interested in agentic
            AI and automation—applications that can reason, remember context,
            and take useful actions for users.

            Hobbies and Interests
          </h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            Outside active development, I enjoy exploring AI coding tools,
            learning how other developers improve their workflows, and
            experimenting with side projects. I especially enjoy automating
            repetitive work because it saves time and turns routine problems
            into satisfying engineering challenges. Programming is no longer
            only something I study—it is also something I genuinely do for fun.

          <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-bold text-white">My Personality</h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-300">
            I am curious, persistent, and always motivated to improve. I prefer
            efficient, organized solutions over brute-force ones, and I treat
            clean code, thoughtful UX, and security as essential parts of a
            finished product. I value feedback and want to grow into a
            full-stack developer who builds products that truly matter to the
            people using them.
